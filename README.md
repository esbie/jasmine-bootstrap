JASMINE-BOOTSTRAP
=================

Do you like writing jasmine specs, but find the TrivialReporter underwhelming to look at? I took the standalone runner at https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases and Twitter's bootstrap css at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap to create jasmine-bootstrap. Here's what it looks like:

![BootstrapReporter](https://github.com/esbie/jasmine-bootstrap/raw/master/test/BootstrapReporter.png)

Here's what the default jasmine-html.js looks like for comparison:

![TrivialReporter](https://github.com/esbie/jasmine-bootstrap/raw/master/test/TrivialReporter.png)

I kept all the TrivialReporter's css classes and most all of its html structure intact. That way jasmine-bootstrap should work with whatever ci you may have already built around the TrivialReporter.

**Does the jasmine-bootstrap reporter change anything else?**

+ showSkipped and showPassed are now url parameters that persist on suite re-run.
+ the spec url parameter is respected by the entire suite, not just by the total number of specs run.

Usage
-----

Grab everything in src/ and link to them in your html file:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/lib/bootstrap.css" type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/jasmine-bootstrap.css" type="text/css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/jasmine-bootstrap.js"></script>
```
You could also grab the minified version of bootstrap.css from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap if you want.
Starting the BootstrapReporter is just like starting the TrivialReporter:

``` html
<script type="text/javascript">
  jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new jasmine.BootstrapReporter());
  jasmine.getEnv().execute();
</script>
```
Full example is in the test/ directory
